If you've got it, chances are, I've worked with it.

Throughout my many years in the information technology field, I've had the chance to implement, debug, design, troubleshoot, architect, install and configure a lot of things from a lot of vendors. The card to the left shows just a few of my favorites.

Over the years, the integration of hardware and software from multiple vendors has always been at the forefront of my mind. This has allowed me to not only learn a single company's methods, but to deep dive into the underlying technology and embrace it from the ground up. I'm able to take that knowledge and apply it to your network and devices to give you the solutions that you need without the headache of choosing a specific vendor. Together, we can decide which implementation is right for you and your company.
